This project is to help crowdsource translate South Indian songs. The objective is 2 folds:
1. Simply translte the songs/poems into other languages 
2. Add commentary/context 

Project file structure:

Each song will have its own folder and the folder will contain 4 files:
1. Each song/poem will be maintained as a text file with the name of the file being the song name. 
2. The song/poem's original language devnagri script.
3. The corresponding translated file will have the same name suffixed with a 2 letter translated language abbreviation. There would be one file for each translated language.
4. A commentary file with the same name suffixed by _comm will also be included 
5. Metadata in a json structure will be part of all 


Ultimate Goal:
1. Every file should be traslated into atleast English.
