The hypnotizing thin jasmine flowers
I offer them to your crown, Mahadeva! 
With the round jasmine flowers!

Andāvare, Mundāvare and other lotus flowers (Andāvare, Mundāvare are names of some lotus flowers)
A garland of Chandakki blooms and a bunch of Bilva leaves, all for You, Mahadeva!
A garland of Chandakki blooms and a bunch of Bilva leaves with Tulasi petals
With these offerings, I have come to worship you, Mahadeva!

I have shined the pooja vessels clean and warmed up ghee
I have brought Orange fruits for You, Mahadeva
I have brought these Orange fruits only for You 
In this time of Your grand festivities (fair) at Your abode, Mahadeva!

Those climbing the Hill yearning Him, why do they desire worldly pleasures?
Believing "You, Mahadeva of the Hill, are their only destiny"
And that, only You and You alone are their eternal fate
They have all renounced their desires for material attachments!

Like the ever-surging Huccēḷḷu flowers, Your festivities have increased many fold
You are the ever-grower Mahadeva, You alone are the ever-riser!
In the Kaudaḷḷi valley of the Seven Hills, Mahadeva
Your festivities have become multi-fold!
